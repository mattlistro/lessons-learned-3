When hiring developers, there are number of considerations around location. There are several options, each with its own pros and cons: 

-Local: Local is my personal preference. It allows easy in-person communication. However, finding good developers locally can be a challenge. Talent in New York in particular is hard ot come by and is very expensive. 

-US/Canada: If a developer isn't local, my second choice is selecting a developer in another part of the US or Canada. He/she will be a in a similar timezone, so communication is easier. Plus, you'll likely have similar cultures, which will facilitate your working relationship. 

-Regional: Regional developers (e.g. someone in Argentina) are also often in the same time zone. And frequently, their culture is more similar to our than that of an Indian, Vietnamese, or truly global developer.

-Global: Global developers are often less expensive but pose many challenges, including timezone and cultural challenges. For example, from a cultural perspective, many Indians traditionally don't like to say no, so managing Indian developers requires setting proper expectations. 

Overall, if you're not working locally, it's important that your developers have experience working remotely. Otherwise, you could face significant challenges in meeting your expectations. 

Also, if you do work remotely, one particularly strong global development shop is Thoughtworks. 

Here's a blog post with some interesting perspectives on outsourcing development. Yes, it's from Barcelona, but the content is still compelling. (http://www.barcinno.com/to-employ-a-full-time-developer-or-outsource-abroad/)
