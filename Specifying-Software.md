One of the main positive things for me from this course was to be more familiar with the process and tools that developers use to build software. One of the mains processes that developers use (yet very simple) is the 3 C’s framework:
•	Card: A small piece of paper (usually a post it sticker) that follows the Connextra format that allow clients/users to explain to developers what they need/expect the functionality to do ("As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>")
•	Conversation: A dialogue between developers and users that aims to clarify and confirm developers understanding of what how the software should work
•	Confirmation: Usually following the Given/When/Then format aims to “test” (without actually testing the software) if the software is going to perform the way expected in different scenarios
