It was very beneficial to learn about epics, user stories and themes and understand the nuances of the three. The key all these was to keep it simple and ensure the message was delivered in a succinct, user friendly format. User stories usually refer to the type of use and the story line is usually along the lines of “as a __, I want __, so __.” As discussed in class, these are usually written on index cards and can be grouped by more overarching themes. Themes, would refer to a collection of user stories. Epics, would be more overarching items that could apply to a variety of users. For example, an epic for an e-commerce website could be having a catalogue of inventory. The user story could be As a New Customer, I want to see Inventory, so I can find what I need.
