Website vs. Mobile 

One of the most useful takeaways I am taking away from this class is now being able to decide whether or not to create a website or mobile app first.  There are clear benefits to each of them, and being able to decipher those will be especially useful moving forward.

Creating a website first is typically recommended, as you can make the necessary changes a lot easier and it is quicker to establish a website versus having to create an app via iOS or Android.  Websites also can be read on mobile devices as well as on a browser based device.  Mobile apps are only recommended if the functionality associated with the app is solely mobile based.  For instance, Uber is a perfect example of this, as it is only used while you are on the go.
