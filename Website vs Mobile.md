Website vs. Mobile 

One of the most useful takeaways I have received from this class is now being able to decide whether or not to create a website or mobile app first.  There are clear benefits to each of them, and being able to decipher those will be especially useful moving forward.

Creating a website first is typically recommended for most startups, as making changes to a website is a lot easier than an app.  Creating an app via iOS or Android can sometimes take extra time, because the changes need to be made and then approved by the platforms being used.  Websites also can be read on mobile devices as well as on a browser based device, which makes it an attractive first choice.  Mobile apps are typically recommended if the functionality associated with the app is solely mobile based.  For instance, Uber is a perfect example of this, as it is only used while you are on the go.  There would be no need for Uber to have begun with a website, because its entire business model is driven by mobile.
