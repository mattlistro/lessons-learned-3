Website vs. Mobile Description

Creating a website first is typically recommended, as you can make the necessary changes easier and it is quicker to establish a website versus having to create an app via iOS or Android.  Websites also can be read on mobile devices as well as on a browser based device.  Mobile apps are only recommended if the functionality associated with the app is solely mobile based.  For instance, Uber is a perfect example of this, as it is only used while you are on the go.
