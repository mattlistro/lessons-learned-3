One of the most valuable things I learned in this class is thinking about what type of developers to hire. It's important to think about the benefits and drawbacks of hiring an in-house person vs. a development team vs. a contractor. Initially, I would have thought an in house, full-time developer would be the least cost-effective choice. However, it was surprising to learn that these developers can cost about half per hour as a part time contractor or dev team. Moreover, I thought that thinking about what time zone your developer is in is another crucial decision. In my personal project, I was thinking that I could use a part-time contractor from India but had not considered the difficulties this might bring about in terms of communication. I think added cost savings won't be worth the hassle in the in end. Another extremely valuable lesson I learned was not to used a fixed fee project, but instead use fixed budget project.

+When structuring contracts, I learned another extremely valuable lesson. In particular, I learned that it was important to use a fixed budget project, not a fixed fee project. In my past experience I have used fixed fee contracts, but Professor Bell made a compelling argument as to why not to go in this direction.
