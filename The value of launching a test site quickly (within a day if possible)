The most valuable takeaway I got from this class was learning about the value of launching a test website quickly in order to gauge buyer or user interest. Wordpress can be a valuable tool in throwing up a quick test website within a day. Simply offering an online email sign-up sheet for more information about my product or service can be incredibly valuable for gaining insight into potential demand. If I plan on selling fancy boots for example, it is powerful to show potential investors a long list of people who have signed up for email notifications about my product, as those sign-ups may later translate to sales. Once my product is ready to go, I could then add a “buy now” button to my site before even adding a shopping cart, which would allow me to start bringing in sales as quickly as possible. A women’s handbag startup that I’m familiar with (Dagne Dover) used a strategy very similar to this and I signed up for their email notifications early on. I’ve attached photos and links of Dagne Dover’s products and site (They’ve since matured and now have a fully flushed out website).

The “lean” launch / minimum viable product concept is incredibly important to keep in mind when innovating and testing the market for potential new products and services. Gathering market data and seeing how users respond to a quickly put together test website will help me prioritize the digital features I will need in order to grow my business. Also, the most efficient way to cut software development costs is to reduce cycle time. Launching a test website quickly is one measure you can take in this spirit.
